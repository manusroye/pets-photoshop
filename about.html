				<h3>About Pet shop</h3>
				<p>
                      A pet shop or pet store is an essential services retailer which sells animals and pet care resources to the public. A variety of animal supplies and pet accessories are also sold in pet shops. The products sold include: food, treats, toys, collars, leashes, cat litter, cages and aquariums.

Pet shops may also offer both hygienic care (such as pet cleaning) and aesthetic services (such as cat and dog grooming).[1] Some pet stores also provide tips on training and behaviour, as well as advice on pet nutrition. Some pet stores provide engraving services for pet tags, which have the owner's contact information in case the pet gets lost.

				<h3>pet shop in Germany</h3>
				<p>
				The largest pet store in the world is located in Duisburg, Germany. Zoo Zajac is located in a 130,000 square-foot warehouse and houses more than 250,000 animals from 3,000 different species. The store has become a tourist attraction, with visitors interacting with it like a zoo.[4]

				<h3>United kingdom</h3>
				<p>
					In 1987, the British pet store trade had an estimated worth of Â£150 million.[5] The largest pet store chain is Pets at Home.[6]

In the United Kingdom, pet stores are prohibited from selling puppies and kittens less than six months old. The ban was announced in 2018 following public pressure to improve animal breeding standards.[7
